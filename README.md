# Prediction-of-Customer-Satisfaction-using-Airline-data
Leverage machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction. This project was part of my Applied Data Science course at Syracuse University

## Motivation
As a mean transportation in our life, airplane could save our time during the trip. The flights are not blocked by mountains, rivers, deserts and oceans. With the development of economy, there is a growing concern over the feedback from the customers about its satisfaction. It will affect the customer’s choice about which flight company which they are going to pick in the fierce competition.

At this time, a survey could directly collect the real feedback from customer, to evaluating their flight, measuring their loyalty, figure out their preference. This project analyzes the satisfaction survey about their flight experience and predicts the satisfaction using the past survey data.

The goal of this project is to identify factors affecting satisfaction of airline customers to improve the customer service and business operations of the airline comapanies

## Technologies and Concepts
Tools and Technologies Used: R, Excel, Tableau, Trello

Concepts: Machine Learning, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Model Evaluation, Predictive Analytics

## Results
Actionable Insights through Visualization and modelling:
1. Female customers are giving lower satisfaction ratings and could be offered a better deal for improvement
2. Aged (60-85) customers are using “Personal Type of travel” and their average satisfaction is low. Hence, personal travel amenities for senior customers should be increased and they should be well-maintained.
3. Premium status classes like Gold, Platinum, Silver are having good customer satisfaction whereas Blue has lower ratings. Therefore, extra services should be provided for convenience of customers travelling through Blue status
4. Customers taking more flights per year are giving low satisfaction ratings. Thus, loyal customers should be provided with discounts and points which might satisfy them in long run
